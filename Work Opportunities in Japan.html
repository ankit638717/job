            <h2>About Japan</h2>
            <p>Japan, island country lying off the east coast of Asia. It consists of a great string of islands in a
            northeast-southwest arc that stretches for approximately 1,500 miles (2,400 km) through the western North Pacific Ocean.
            Nearly the entire land area is taken up by the country's four main islands; from north to south these are Hokkaido
            (Hokkaidō), Honshu (Honshū), Shikoku, and Kyushu (Kyūshū). Honshu is the largest of the four, followed in size by
            Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku. In addition, there are numerous smaller islands, the major groups of which are the Ryukyu
            (Nansei) Islands (including the island of Okinawa) to the south and west of Kyushu and the Izu, Bonin (Ogasawara), and
            Volcano (Kazan) islands to the south and east of central Honshu. The national capital, Tokyo (Tōkyō), in east-central
            Honshu, is one of the world's most populous cities.

            The Japanese landscape is rugged, with more than four-fifths of the land surface consisting of mountains. There are many
            active and dormant volcanoes, including Mount Fuji (Fuji-san), which, at an elevation of 12,388 feet (3,776 meters), is
            Japan's highest mountain. Abundant precipitation and the generally mild temperatures throughout most of the country have
            produced a lush vegetation cover and, despite the mountainous terrain and generally poor soils, have made it possible to
            raise a variety of crops. Japan has a large and, to a great extent, ethnically homogeneous population, which is heavily
            concentrated in the low-lying areas along the Pacific coast of Honshu.

            The Kinkaku Temple (Golden Pavilion) in Kyōto, Japan, was originally built in the 15th century; the present structure
            dates to the 1950s.

            Complexity and contrast are the keynotes of life in Japan—a country possessing an intricate and ancient cultural
            tradition yet one that, since 1950, has emerged as one of the world's most economically and technologically advanced
            societies. Heavy emphasis is placed on education, and Japan is one of the world's most literate countries. Tension
            between old and new is apparent in all phases of Japanese life. A characteristic sensitivity to natural beauty and a
            concern with form and balance are evident in such cities as Kyōto and Nara, as well as in Japan's ubiquitous gardens.
            Even in the countryside, however, the impact of rapid Westernization is evident in many aspects of Japanese life. The
            agricultural regions are characterized by low population densities and well-ordered rice fields and fruit orchards,
            whereas the industrial and urbanized belt along the Pacific coast of Honshu is noted for its highly concentrated
            population, heavy industrialization, and environmental pollution.
            
            Humans have occupied Japan for tens of thousands of years, but Japan's recorded history begins only in the 1st century
            BCE, with mention in Chinese sources. Contact with China and Korea in the early centuries CE brought profound changes to
            Japan, including the Chinese writing system, Buddhism, and many artistic forms from the continent. The first steps at
            political unification of the country occurred in the late 4th and early 5th centuries CE under the Yamato court. A great
            civilization then developed first at Nara in the 8th century and then at Heian-kyō (now Kyōto) from the late 8th to the
            late 12th century. The seven centuries thereafter were a period of domination by military rulers culminating in near
            isolation from the outside world from the early 17th to the mid-19th country.
